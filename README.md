# Setup

## Installation Instructions

First install composer
https://getcomposer.org/

Then install the kirby client globally via composer:
```$ composer global require getkirby/cli```


Place the directory `~/.composer/vendor/bin`in your PATH:
```$ export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"```


Finally install composer dependencies
```$ composer install```

This will not only install the dependencies (which include twig support for the kirby cms) but also execute a postinstall, which installs a core installation of kirby.


Further installation steps are required. To do so, go to the `theme` directory with your terminal. Node and the node package manager need to be installed prior to the next steps.

```$ nvm use```
```$ npm install```

Now everything should be installed properly.





## System and Usage

A site consists of pages and modules (twig templates), which are scaffolded the estatico-way.
Check https://github.com/unic/estatico for further information on how to scaffold modules and run a local server.

For a working kirby environment an application (like AMPPS) is needed, to run php-scripts locally.

When writing twig pages and modules they will – if the gulp task is running – copy the page-templates to the `kirby/site/templates` directory. Twig modules will be copied to the ``kirby/site/templates/modules` directory. Twig layouts in the corresponding `layouts` directory.

Controller files do handle the data for the templates. Kirby looks for a controller file with the same name like the page. This file does actually control which data is required for this specific page.

Everytime a page is loaded the site.php is called. The only thing site.php does is calling the `theme_data.php`. Theme Data is a class with methods to provide specific data.

Example:
```
<?php

/* Project Controller*/

return function($site, $pages, $page) {

    $theme_data = new ThemeData();

    $data = [];

    $data['images'] = $theme_data->getPageImages();
    $data['globals'] = $theme_data->getGlobals();

    return $data;
};
```

The above code resides within a controller file. It will return the page images and some global data (for example: all active pages for the navigation).

```
public function getGlobals() {
		$globals = [];
		// get only visible pages
		$globals['menu_pages'] = $this->kirby->site()->pages()->visible();
		return $globals;
	}
```

Shown is the getGlobals function of the ThemeData class. In this case the getGlobals is collecting all visible pages.
